# Book Application
The project is an appointment management application designed for anyone who wants to book an appointment in any organization and also for any organization owner - who wants to make an order in the queues belonging to his organization.

 Today any organization or stakeholder who has an appointment has a certain way of getting the appointments and arranging them. But on the other hand the customer who needs to book an appointment at several different companies must go to all the organizations where he is interested in booking the appointment or call or get physically to the required place and make the requested appointment. This takes a lot of time and effort from the customer.

Through the app we have developed, we centralize in one place the whole issue of scheduling appointments. Through the app, we can book an appointment with various companies that have a contract with the app. Since the whole matter of scheduling appointments will be in one place, the process of ordering the appointment by the customer will be more efficient and fast and even in terms of organization organization management the app will facilitate management / update and follow-up After the queues.
